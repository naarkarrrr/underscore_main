                                <p class="mil-up mil-mb-60">Broadcasting rights are a significant source of income for cricket boards in the digital age. The broadcast rights to ICC matches have been acquired by Star Sports for a four-year contract worth $3 billion (about 24,000 crore rupees). In the meantime, Jio Cinema has grown in popularity as a place where cricket fans can easily stream the full match live.<br><br>During a single match, around 35 cameras are used to provide these broadcasts. They consist of tracking cameras, drones, hyper motion cameras, slow motion cameras, spider cameras, and buggy cameras. Unlike what many people think, these expensive cameras are brought in just for the matches rather than being permanently positioned at the sites. The cost of some camera lenses alone might reach 40–50 lakh rupees, highlighting the considerable technological investment needed to improve the viewing experience.</p>

                                <h5 class="mil-up mil-mb-30">Cutting-Edge Cricket Venue.</h5>
                                <p class="mil-up mil-mb-60">The integration of eye control, which was first offered in Vision Pro, onto iPhones running iOS 18 represents a major improvement in accessibility. With the use of this cutting-edge innovation, users can now manage their iPhones entirely with eye motions, providing a fluid and natural method to navigate menus, launch apps, and carry out other functions without the need for physical contact. Eye control offers a useful substitute for those with movement issues by utilizing cutting-edge eye-tracking technology, enabling them to utilize their gadgets more independently and comfortably.<br><br>
                                Eye control improves the iPhone experience for all users by providing a hands-free option that is perfect for multitasking or scenarios where touch contact is impractical, in addition to its advantages for users with impairments. With the addition of eye control, Apple has proven its commitment to accessibility and innovation. They are committed to developing technology that removes obstacles and helps people easily incorporate technology into their daily lives. With iOS 18, Apple is still at the forefront of the industry's efforts to increase everyone's access to and comfort with cutting-edge technology.</p>

                                <h5 class="mil-up mil-mb-30">Game Experience</h5>
                                <p class="mil-up mil-mb-60">iOS 18's game mode improves performance by assigning resources more effectively and giving priority to games in order to guarantee responsive and fluid gameplay. This optimization offers a consistent and entertaining gaming experience, especially for demanding games that need high processing power and graphics performance.<br><br>
                                Additionally, game mode reduces disruptions by automatically modifying system preferences to lower background activity and notifications while playing games. This makes it easier for players to concentrate and enjoy their gameplay sessions without getting distracted by notifications from other apps, calls, or messages.<br><br>
                                With the launch of game mode, Apple has demonstrated its dedication to catering to the many interests and requirements of its user base, which includes ardent gamers. By adding specialized features like game mode to improve the gaming experience, Apple ensures that iPhone users can enjoy high-quality gaming experiences that rival those on dedicated gaming consoles and PCs.

                                <p class="mil-up mil-mb-60">Alongside iOS 18, AirPods have also seen substantial improvements. Users can now engage with their device without using their hands by nodding their head to indicate yes or no thanks to the new nod gestures feature.

This improvement greatly raises the quality of calls, increasing the effectiveness and enjoyment of conversations. By addressing a typical problem with background noise, the voice isolation feature makes sure that the user's speech is heard clearly.</p>
